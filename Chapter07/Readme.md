Due to licensing restrictions, I have deleted the ext library folder and saas folder. To run this sample application, clone or download, and add the content of ext library folder and saas folder generated by SenchaCmd, and run the following command.

Note, this example uses cloudflare CDN for ExtJS 6. If the CDN doesn't work, you may need to update ExtJS lib urls in index.html and point to the local ExtJS library path.

The installation guide for ExtJS 6 and Sencha Cmd are explained in the book "[ExtJS by Example](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/ext-js-example)".
